# Application-of-Pareto-Front-to-Multi-Objective-Genetic-Optimization

## TO-DO

1. Figure out how to implement shuffling with grey code
2. ~~Set up a class skeleton with a random start and calculate fitness functionality~~
3. ~~reate fitness function~~
4. Create an evaluate function that runs one iteration and shuffles
5. Create a vizualuzation for fitness output i.e fitnesshistory


## IDEAS

1. Implement micro genetic algorithm
2. Use Chankong and Haimes test func for evaluation
3. The range is [-20, 20], idea is to map small ranges in that range to binary numbers, for example with 1 bit we would have 0 as -20 and 1 as 20
